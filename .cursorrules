# Project Rules: Mental Health Companion

## 📋 Update Protocol (CRITICAL)

### After EVERY code change:
1. **Update PROGRESS_TRACKER.md** with:
   - Date
   - Commit hash (after committing)
   - Current phase
   - Feature being worked on
   - Change type (Feature/Fix/Refactor/Documentation)
   - Brief description of changes
   - Rationale (why this change?)
   - Files affected

2. **Git commit** with descriptive message:
   - Use emoji prefixes (✨ feature, 🐛 fix, 🎨 style, 📝 docs, ♻️ refactor)
   - Clear description of what changed
   - Why it changed (if not obvious)

3. **Push to GitHub** for Vercel auto-deploy

## 🎯 Development Principles

1. **One Step at a Time**
   - Make small, testable changes
   - User tests on live Vercel deployment after each push
   - Validate before moving to next feature

2. **Progress Over Perfection**
   - Ship working features quickly
   - Iterate based on real usage
   - Don't over-engineer

3. **Voice-First Philosophy**
   - Design for voice, support text
   - Big mic button as hero element
   - Text always available as alternative

4. **Emotional Connection First**
   - Prioritize personalization and relationship building
   - Stats can wait, emotional stickiness can't
   - Mode selector and onboarding in Phase 1

5. **Build for Yourself**
   - Dogfood everything
   - If you wouldn't use it, don't ship it
   - Real venting sessions = best validation

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

1. **Don't skip the tracker**
   - Every commit = tracker update
   - No exceptions

2. **Don't build multiple features at once**
   - One feature at a time
   - Complete → Test → Next

3. **Don't over-scope**
   - Stick to current phase
   - Resist adding "just one more thing"
   - Future explorations go in backlog

4. **Don't break the live site**
   - Test locally first when possible
   - Small changes = easier to debug
   - Vercel preview deployments for big changes

## 📁 File Organization

### Key Files:
- `VISION_ROADMAP_v11.30_FINAL.md` - North star vision
- `PROGRESS_TRACKER.md` - Update with every change
- `frontend/pages/index.tsx` - Main app logic
- `frontend/components/VoiceButton.tsx` - Recording component
- `frontend/pages/api/` - Backend API routes

### Update Frequency:
- **Every commit:** PROGRESS_TRACKER.md
- **Weekly:** Check alignment with VISION_ROADMAP
- **After phase:** Reflect on what worked/didn't

## 🎨 Code Style

1. **TypeScript:** Strict typing where possible
2. **Comments:** Explain WHY, not WHAT
3. **Functions:** Small, single-purpose
4. **State:** Keep it simple, useState for now
5. **UI:** Clean, warm, cozy aesthetic

## ✅ Testing Protocol

1. **Local:** Test basic functionality
2. **Vercel:** User tests live deployment
3. **Dogfood:** Use it yourself for real venting
4. **Phase validation:** Complete success criteria before moving on

## 🔄 Git Workflow

1. **Main branch:** Always deployable
2. **Feature branches:** For experiments (optional for solo dev)
3. **Commit often:** Small, logical commits
4. **Descriptive messages:** Future you will thank you

## 🎯 Current Focus

**Phase:** Phase 1 - Foundation + Relationship Building  
**Feature:** Hybrid Recording System  
**Goal:** Unlimited venting + live transcription  
**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks (flexible)
