## 📝 Detailed Changelog

### **Nov 30, 2025**

#### 🎤 Hybrid Recording - Step 1: Audio Chunking (Commit: 8aae00b)
**Phase:** Phase 1 - Foundation  
**Feature:** Hybrid Recording System  
**Type:** Feature

**Changes:**
- **VoiceButton.tsx:**
  - Added `onChunkRecorded` prop for live chunk processing
  - Added chunk interval timer (30-second chunks)
  - Removed 5-minute max duration limit (now effectively unlimited!)
  - Updated UI: Shows M:SS format, "unlimited length" messaging
  - Clear chunk interval on stop/error
  
- **audioRecorder.ts:**
  - Added `getChunk()` method to extract accumulated audio
  - Returns blob without stopping recording
  - Keeps all chunks for final audio (doesn't clear on chunk extraction)

**Rationale:**
- Enable unlimited venting (core differentiator!)
- Foundation for live transcription
- Prepare for Supabase Storage upload (handles large files)
- Better UX (no artificial time limits)

**Technical Details:**
- Chunks every 30 seconds via setInterval
- getChunk() creates blob from accumulated data
- Full audio buffer maintained for final upload
- No file size checks (handled differently now)

**Files:**
- `frontend/components/VoiceButton.tsx`
- `frontend/utils/audioRecorder.ts`

**Next Step:** Wire up chunk processing in index.tsx for live transcription

#### ✨ Hybrid Recording - Step 2: Live Transcription (Commit: 7a8208a)
**Phase:** Phase 1 - Foundation  
**Feature:** Hybrid Recording System  
**Type:** Feature

**Changes:**
- **index.tsx:**
  - Added `liveTranscript` state for real-time transcription display
  - Added `handleChunkRecorded()` function to process 30-second chunks
  - Modified `handleAudioRecorded()` to use live transcript (hybrid approach)
  - Fallback to full audio transcription if live transcript empty
  - Added live transcription preview UI (animated blue box)
  - Shows word count and updates in real-time
  - Stores full audio blob for future Supabase upload

**Rationale:**
- CRITICAL: Makes unlimited recording actually work!
- Chunks transcribed as recording happens (no 413 errors)
- User sees their words appear live (better UX)
- Fallback ensures reliability
- Hybrid: live chunks + full audio saved

**Technical Details:**
- Chunks sent to `/api/transcribe` every 30 seconds
- Transcripts appended to `liveTranscript` state
- Full audio blob stored in ref for later upload
- Silent failures on chunk errors (don't interrupt recording)
- Shows word count and animated preview

**User Experience:**
- ✅ Record for unlimited time
- ✅ See words appear as you speak
- ✅ No more 413 errors for long recordings
- ✅ Full audio preserved for playback later

**Files:**
- `frontend/pages/index.tsx`

**Next Step:** Upload full audio to Supabase Storage (Step 3)

---

#### 🐛 Fix: Compilation Error (Commit: 7df0764)
**Phase:** Phase 1 - Foundation  
**Feature:** Hybrid Recording System  
**Type:** Fix (Critical)

**Issue:**
- Build failed with "Cannot find name 'transcribeData'"
- Changed `transcribeData` to `finalTranscript` in refactor
- Missed updating 2 references

**Fix:**
- Line 1206: `message: transcribeData.text` → `finalTranscript`
- Line 1295: `extractAndSaveMemories(transcribeData.text)` → `finalTranscript`

**Impact:**
- Build now compiles successfully
- Vercel deployment working again

**Files:**
- `frontend/pages/index.tsx`

---

#### ✨ Hybrid Recording - Step 3: Faster Chunks + Final Chunk Fix (Dec 4, 2025)
**Phase:** Phase 1 - Foundation  
**Feature:** Hybrid Recording System  
**Type:** Feature + Bug Fix (Critical)

**Changes:**

**1. Faster Live Transcription (30s → 5s chunks):**
- Changed `CHUNK_DURATION_MS` from 30s to 5s
- Near real-time feel (updates every 5 seconds)
- Same cost (Whisper charges per audio duration, not per call!)

**2. CRITICAL BUG FIX: Final Chunk Missing:**
- Previous issue: When user stopped recording between intervals, the last <5s of audio was lost!
- Added `getNewChunks()` method: Only transcribes NEW audio since last call (no re-transcription!)
- Added `getFinalChunk()` method: Captures remaining audio when stopping
- `handleAudioRecorded()` now transcribes final chunk before sending message
- `VoiceButton` now passes `finalChunk` to parent component

**3. Tab Visibility Handling:**
- Added `visibilitychange` event listener
- Recording continues when tab is hidden (swipe to another tab)
- Shows "Recording continues in background" message when tab hidden
- Logs visibility changes for debugging

**Technical Details:**
- `audioRecorder.ts`: Added `lastChunkIndex` tracking
- `getNewChunks()`: Returns only chunks since last call (incremental)
- `getFinalChunk()`: Returns remaining unsent chunks
- `VoiceButton`: Changed callback signature to include `finalChunk`
- `index.tsx`: Transcribes `finalChunk` before processing message

**Before/After:**
```
BEFORE (30s chunks, missing final audio):
0:00 - Start
0:30 - Chunk 1 ✅
1:00 - Chunk 2 ✅
1:45 - Stop → Last 45s LOST! ❌

AFTER (5s chunks, captures everything):
0:00 - Start
0:05 - Chunk 1 ✅
0:10 - Chunk 2 ✅
...
1:40 - Chunk 20 ✅
1:45 - Stop → Final 5s captured ✅
```

**Files:**
- `frontend/utils/audioRecorder.ts`
- `frontend/components/VoiceButton.tsx`
- `frontend/pages/index.tsx`

**User Experience:**
- ✅ Live transcription updates every 5 seconds (feels near-real-time!)
- ✅ NO MORE MISSING AUDIO at the end
- ✅ Recording continues in background tabs
- ✅ Same cost as before (Whisper charges by audio duration)

**Next Step:** Test with 10+ minute recording to validate

#### ✨ Vision Revision (Commit: cb90b06)
**Phase:** Planning  
**Feature:** Vision & Roadmap  
**Type:** Documentation

**Changes:**
- Revised positioning: "Therapist in pocket" → "Mental health companion"

- Updated language: "Unlimited" → "Effectively unlimited"
- Clarified voice-first philosophy: "Voice-first, not voice-only"
- Made pricing flexible: ~$15/month placeholder
- Softened timelines: 2-4 weeks (not strict 2 weeks)
- Updated scope control: "Not building" → "Future explorations"
- Made tone more grounded and founder-like
